# Foxtrot-Learning-Log-2022
Weekly Learning Log

This is a learning log for my 10-week front end engineer internship at Foxtrot in Chicago. The log includes:

1. Weekly summaries
2. Technical notes
3. Hints/Reminders
4. Resources
5. Questions to guide further improvement

The purpose of this log is to document my learning and development as a front end engineer. It is also serves me as practical guide for
my day-to-day experiences as a web developer; whenever I got stuck on something, I recorded the solution in this guide!
